  - Predictions weighted by Elo difference.

- **Tasks:**
  - [ ] Define Elo formula.
  - [ ] Create CSV for initial team ratings.
  - [ ] Integrate Elo into prediction model.

---

### Story 1.4 â€” Elo Updates (Dynamic)
**As an admin, I want team ratings to change after each match, so that future predictions reflect results.**

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Elo ratings update after every result.
  - Handle win/draw/loss correctly.
  - Save updated Elo ratings back to CSV.

- **Tasks:**
  - [ ] Implement update function.

### Story 2.3 â€” Results Entry
**As an admin, I want to enter match results, so that Elo updates automatically.**

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Results accepted in bulk or interactively.
  - Elo updates applied correctly.
  - Updated ratings saved.

- **Tasks:**
  - [ ] Create result input parser.
  - [ ] Validate scores.
  - [ ] Update ratings.

---

### Story 2.4 â€” Historical Accuracy Tracking
**As an analyst, I want to track prediction accuracy, so that I can improve the model.**

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Save predicted vs actual results.
  - Compute accuracy metrics (e.g., Brier score).
  - Generate summary report.

- **Tasks:**
  - [ ] Save predictions + results to file.
  - [ ] Implement accuracy calculation.
  - [ ] Create reporting function.

---

## âœ… Epic 3: User Interface
